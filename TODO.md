## TODO For V 0.1.0
- x Automatic browser open
- x tyranno-serve
- x Format like a champ: https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static/blob/master/index.js
- x Automatic refresh
  - x Switch to ""send"" instead of node-static
  - x If we should load the file, do stupid file sending (read the whole file, do a regex, then send the modified file back).
  - x Actually listen for the websocket
  - x Deal with send error, directory
- x Response.internalServer error and notFound defaults. Routeparam defaults. Create ResponseAugmenter with mixin(response)
- x Switch to adding route params to the request object
- x Add handlers for send''s error, and directory
- x Load from settings file
    - x settings file specified with --settings (use base directory of this file)
    - x Default settings file detection: tyranno.json
    - x be sure absolute paths work
- x Loading settings through settings file in code should work the same as from CLI, need to have common code
- x Filepath fallback

  - x test a txt file can be served
  - x Turn off watchr on close
  - x Test javascript insertion (just look for script tag)
  - x test fallback
  - x test most specific first rule
  - x ''/users/:userId'' and ''/users/:userId/products/:productId/''
- x Refactor: multiple files
- c Support multiple variable names at the same location
- c Multiple settings files with include?
- x samples
- x Console variables. Console variables are the process of converting what comes in on the command line to the JSON type object we use from the settings files.
  - x scour live-server for all args and provide comparable implementations, if not better
  - x host
  - x no-browser
  - x quiet
  - x paths
  - ? (doesn''t seem to work though I am passing it around right) ignore-paths in watchr (filenames passed in from CLI to watcher)

  - x Version: var packageJson = require(''./package.json'');
  - x Help CLI: documentation of all commands must be present in readme and in -h and --help
  - x Open options (open can be specified multiple times)
  - x Command line overwrites settings file (with test)
  - x Port settings
  - x no-listen
  - x paths: fallback on CLI
  - x If a command line argument is presented without a label, add it to the '' path (uniquely)
  - x args settings file
- x Full documentation: it doesn''t look like there is an awesome doc generator but jsdoc might be ok if it supports classes, otherwise just write the doc.
- c coverage: istanbul \_mocha
- x Settable custom 404, including command line path (and 401, 403, and 500 as well)
    - x ResponseSender should have a file method that allows you to send files over.
    - x What if you notfound something that doesn''t exist?
    - x Should be able to pass notfound, etc in on CLI
- x export mime, use send''s mime.
- x Rework readme
- x Add per path listen options.
- x Use in a personal project
    - x BUG: if ends in a slash, should still be able to find
- x When paths is not passed in CWD is not used
- x icon
- upload to git
- upload to npm
